# Ivo Boss

Simply Ivo boss inspired game that let you avoid devops and collect kinder buenos

## How to run

1. Place the provided costume image at `assets/player.png` (PNG with ~1:1 ratio works best).
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (double-click or use a local server).
3. Press **Play** or hit the **Space** key to start, then tap/space/click to flap through the pipes.

Scores persist locally via `localStorage`. If the image fails to load, the game falls back to a colored rectangle, so double-check the file path/name.
